PROJECT PLAN — MCP-Based AI Agent System
Project Intent

The goal of this project is to build a modular, containerized AI agent system powered by:

Python

FastAPI (backend/API orchestrator)

Ollama Granite (LLM)

MCP Servers (FastMCP-based tools)

Gradio UI

Docker Compose (multi-container orchestration)

This system will be a production-ready, extensible architecture where the LLM can interact with external capabilities through standardized MCP-enabled microservices — rather than custom embedded tools.

The final result is a clean, maintainable, testable agent platform, suitable for adding new capabilities simply by spinning up additional MCP servers.
